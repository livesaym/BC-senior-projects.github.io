                <h2>About Me</h2>
		<p> I am a senior at Berea College and I am majoring in Computer Science.
		I am currently enrolled in the senior project class where I get to put what
			I learned to the test in developing an application of my own choosing.
		I don't really have much more to say, but you can always check out the class's website.</p>
